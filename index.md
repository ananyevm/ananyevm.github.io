Welcome! I am a Research Fellow in [The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I am interested in applying methods of causal inference, and, more broadly, computational social science to the problems of political economy.

I received Ph.D. in [Political Science](http://polisci.ucla.edu/) and M.Sc. in [Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) from [The University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/) in June 2018. I received M.A. in Economics from [The New Economic School](https://www.nes.ru/en/home/?lang=en) and B.Sc. in Physics from [The Novosibirsk State University](https://english.nsu.ru/).

You can find my CV [here](assets/ananyevcv.pdf).
